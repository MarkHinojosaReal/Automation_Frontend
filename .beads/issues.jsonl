{"id":"atfe-8hb","title":"Rezen File Downloader: process hangs + message channel errors","description":"**Task:** Investigate and fix the Rezen File Downloader tool hanging when used, and the repeated \"message channel closed\" console errors.\n\n**Observed:**\n- Process gets hung when using Rezen File Downloader\n- Repeated console errors: `A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received` (tools:1)\n- Error appears many times (30+ in user report)\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Message channel error:** This is a known Chrome extension error — occurs when an extension's message listener returns `true` (async response) but the channel closes before responding. NOT from app code. Common culprits: React DevTools, Redux DevTools, password managers, ad blockers. Suggest testing in incognito (extensions disabled) to isolate. If hang persists without the error, the error is extension noise.\n- **Hang investigation:** Client `handleRezenDownload` in tools.tsx (line 562) fetches `/api/rezen/download-transaction` or `/api/rezen/download-agent` with no timeout. Server (server/utils/rezen.js) fetches from reZEN APIs (arrakis, sherlock, dropbox), builds zip via archiver, streams response. For large transactions, this can take minutes. Client may appear hung while waiting.\n- **Potential fixes:** (1) Add AbortController + timeout (e.g. 120s) to client fetch; (2) Add progress/status updates during long server operations; (3) Stream response with progress if possible; (4) Show \"This may take several minutes for large transactions\" message; (5) Ensure `setRezenDownloading(false)` runs on all paths (including fetch abort)\n- **Server:** rezenFetch has 30s timeout per request; multiple sequential fetches (transaction → checklist → documents → dropbox files) can exceed that; archiver zip build adds more time. Consider timeout for overall handler.\n- **Files:** src/pages/tools.tsx (handleRezenDownload), server/utils/rezen.js\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Root cause for hang identified (client timeout, server slowness, or extension interference)\n- [ ] Client fetch has timeout/abort so UI doesn't appear frozen indefinitely\n- [ ] User gets feedback during long operations (or clear \"may take several minutes\" message)\n- [ ] Message channel error confirmed as extension-related (or fixed if app-caused)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mark.hinojosa@therealbrokerage.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T23:06:43.441941-08:00","created_by":"MarkHinojosaReal","updated_at":"2026-02-26T23:19:29.163699-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-26T23:19:29.163699-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

The click-to-open-YouTrack behavior must remain unchanged.\n\n**Current behavior:**\n- BarChartCard uses `.card` class (global.css line 49) which has `hover:scale-[1.02]` — entire container pops out on hover\n- Bars have `onClick` and `cursor: pointer` for YouTrack navigation\n- Both charts: handlePriorityBarClick, handleStatusBarClick in index.tsx\n\n**Desired behavior:**\n- Remove container hover pop (no scale/shadow change on card when hovering anywhere)\n- Add bar-only hover effect: individual bars \"pop up\" (e.g. scale, fill change, or shadow) when hovering over a bar\n- Click on bar still opens YouTrack — unchanged\n\n**Approach:**\n- **BarChartCard:** Use a non-interactive card variant for the wrapper — e.g. `card` without hover scale, or new class `card-static` / `chart-card` that omits `hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-2xl`. Apply only to BarChartCard on home page, or add `noHoverScale` prop to use different wrapper class.\n- **Bar hover:** Recharts Bar supports `activeBar` prop for styling the bar when hovered/active. Use `activeBar={{ fillOpacity: 1, strokeWidth: 1, ... }}` or custom `shape` with scale/transform. Alternatively, use CSS on the bar SVG elements (Recharts renders SVG) — `.recharts-bar-rectangle:hover { transform: scaleY(1.05) }` or similar. Recharts Bar/Cell may need `activeBar` or `activeShape` for per-bar hover.\n- **Files:** src/components/BarChartCard.tsx, src/styles/global.css (if new class), src/pages/index.tsx (if BarChartCard needs prop)\n- **Scope:** Home page bar charts only (Projects by Priority, Projects by Status).

Reuse existing helpers: getTransactionDetails → getChecklistItems → extractChecklistDocuments (count) + extractDropboxIds → getDropboxFiles (count). Do NOT call getChecklistDocDownloadUrl, getFileDownloadUrl, or downloadFileContent — only count. Return total count.\n- **Validate handler:** Call `getTransactionFileCount` after `getTransactionDetails` succeeds.

{"id":"atfe-oki","title":"Projects table: Column header sort asc/desc overrides custom Sort option","description":"**Task:** Add sortable column headers to the Projects table view. Clicking a column header sorts asc/desc (toggle on same column). Column header sort takes precedence over the custom Sort option (Filters/Sort sidebar) when both are in effect — i.e. header sort overrides.\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Scope:** Table view only (ProjectTable). Card view unchanged.\n- **Columns to sort:** Issue ID, Summary, Status, Priority, Assignee, Initiative, Reporter, Created\n- **Behavior:** Click header → sort by that column asc; click again → desc; click different column → sort by new column asc\n- **Override rule:** When user has selected a custom sort (Sort sidebar: Last Updated, Date Created, Priority), clicking a table column header replaces that with the column sort. Column header sort is the active sort when in table view and a header has been clicked.\n- **State:** Add `tableSortBy` and `tableSortOrder` in ProjectList (or `tableColumnSort: { column, order } | null`). When viewMode is table and tableColumnSort is set, use it for sorting filteredProjects; else use sortBy/sortOrder from Sort sidebar.\n- **ProjectTable:** Accept `sortColumn`, `sortOrder`, `onSort(column, order)` props. Make headers clickable (button or th with onClick), cursor-pointer. Show sort indicator (chevron up/down) on active column.\n- **ProjectList:** Pass sort state and callback to ProjectTable; apply table sort in the filteredProjects sort step when viewMode is table and tableColumnSort is set.

{"id":"atfe-xbe","title":"Projects page: Export filtered/sorted report to CSV","description":"**Task:** Add an Export button on the Projects page that exports the current filtered and sorted report to a .csv file. The button should be inline with the Cards/Table view toggle row but not necessarily on the same side (e.g. view toggle left, export right).\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Placement:** Same row as View Toggle (Cards | Table), inline — e.g. `flex justify-between items-center` with view toggle on left, Export button on right. Or `flex items-center gap-4` with both in the row. User said \"not necessarily on the same side\" so opposite side is fine.\n- **Data source:** Export `filteredProjects` — the same data shown in cards/table after filters, search, and sort are applied. Use ProjectList's filteredProjects (already computed).\n- **CSV columns:** Match table view for consistency: Issue ID, Summary, Status, Priority, Assignee, Initiative, Reporter, Created. Optionally add Updated, Requestor. Use Ticket type from src/types/index.ts.\n- **CSV generation:** Client-side only — build CSV string from filteredProjects, escape fields (quotes, commas, newlines per RFC 4180), create Blob, trigger download via `URL.createObjectURL` + `\u003ca download\u003e`. No server round-trip.\n- **Filename:** e.g. `projects-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` or `projects-{timestamp}.csv`\n- **Button styling:** Match design system (ocean, breeze). Use Download or FileDown icon from lucide-react. Same visual weight as Open in YouTrack / view toggle.\n- **Files:** src/components/ProjectList.tsx (add Export button, export handler)\n- **Utility:** Consider `src/utils/csvExport.ts` for `exportToCsv(rows, columns)` — reusable, testable. Escape: wrap in quotes if contains comma/newline/quote; double internal quotes.\n- **Edge cases:** Empty filteredProjects — disable button or show \"No data to export\"; large exports — client-side is fine for typical project counts (hundreds).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Export button visible inline with Cards/Table row (opposite side or same row)\n- [ ] Clicking exports filteredProjects to .csv with correct columns\n- [ ] CSV properly escaped (commas, quotes, newlines)\n- [ ] Filename includes date or timestamp\n- [ ] Filters, search, and sort all apply to exported data\n- [ ] Button disabled or clear feedback when no projects to export","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mark.hinojosa@therealbrokerage.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T23:30:28.731822-08:00","created_by":"MarkHinojosaReal","updated_at":"2026-02-26T23:43:15.443837-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-26T23:43:15.443837-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
