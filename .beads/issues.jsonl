{"id":"atfe-sxa","title":"Projects page: Open filtered view in YouTrack (like bar chart links)","description":"**Task:** Add an \"Open in YouTrack\" action on the Projects page that opens YouTrack with the current filters applied as a report query — similar to the clickable bar charts on the home page.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Reference implementation: `src/pages/index.tsx` — `handlePriorityBarClick`, `handleStatusBarClick` build YouTrack query URLs; StatsCard uses `href` to link to filtered YouTrack views\n- URL format: `{YOUTRACK_BASE}/projects/ATOP/issues?q={encodeURIComponent(query)}` — use `VITE_YOUTRACK_BASE_URL` or fallback `https://realbrokerage.youtrack.cloud`\n- YouTrack query syntax: `type: Project` base; values with spaces need braces (e.g. `state: {In Progress}`, `priority: {3 - Low}`); multiple values comma-separated; negation via `-field: value`\n- ProjectList (`src/components/ProjectList.tsx`) holds filter state: selectedStates, selectedPriorities, selectedRequestors, selectedAssignees, selectedInitiatives, stateFilterMode, priorityFilterMode, etc.\n- Add a utility (e.g. `src/utils/buildYouTrackQuery.ts`) to convert ProjectList filter state → YouTrack query string. Map include/exclude modes to YouTrack query syntax.\n- Add \"Open in YouTrack\" button/link in ProjectList header area (near Filters/Sort buttons) or in projects.tsx — when clicked, build query from current filters and `window.open(url, '_blank')`\n- Search term (searchTerm) may not map to YouTrack query — consider omitting or mapping to summary/text search if YouTrack supports it\n- Reuse existing patterns: `getYouTrackUrl` in ProjectCard/SimpleProjectCard for base URL; design system (ocean, breeze, accent) for button styling\n- No server changes required — client-side only\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] \"Open in YouTrack\" button visible on Projects page when filters are shown\n- [ ] Clicking opens YouTrack in new tab with `type: Project` plus current filter criteria (state, priority, requestor, assignee, initiative) applied\n- [ ] Include-mode filters map to positive query clauses; exclude-mode maps to negation\n- [ ] Values with spaces (e.g. \"In Progress\", \"3 - Low\") use YouTrack brace syntax\n- [ ] Button disabled or hidden when no filters applied (optional — or always show with base `type: Project` query)\n- [ ] Matches UX of home page bar chart / StatsCard links (new tab, same project/query format)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mark.hinojosa@therealbrokerage.com","created_at":"2026-02-25T22:39:51.218026-08:00","created_by":"MarkHinojosaReal","updated_at":"2026-02-25T22:53:19.530653-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-25T22:53:19.530653-08:00","close_reason":"Added Open in YouTrack button to Projects page toolbar.
